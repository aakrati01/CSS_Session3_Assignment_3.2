	<h2> JAVA DEFINATION</h2>
	<p> Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
	<img src="java.png" alt=" java image" height="200px" >
	<p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.<br> The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>
